    "For example, an LDA model might have topics that can be classified as CAT_related and DOG_related. A topic has probabilities of generating various words, such as milk, meow, and kitten, which can be classified and interpreted by the viewer as \"CAT_related\". Naturally, the word cat itself will have high probability given this topic. The DOG_related topic likewise has probabilities of generating each word: puppy, bark, and bone might have high probability. Words without special relevance, such as \"the\" (see function word), will have roughly even probability between classes (or can be placed into a separate category). A topic is neither semantically nor epistemologically strongly defined. It is identified on the basis of automatic detection of the likelihood of term co-occurrence. A lexical word may occur in several topics with a different probability, however, with a different typical set of neighboring words in each topic.\n",
