# Hotel-Review-NLP-Project

-- Project Status: Completed

# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to classify and group most common issues in Luxury European Hotelsâ€™ negative reviews into specific topics utilizing Topic Modelling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

# Methods Used
* Data Visualization 
* Model: Latent Dirichlet allocation
* Machine Learning

# Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter
* Packages/Libraries: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), pyLDAvis

# Project Description
The data [515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe), collected from Kaggle, contains 51.5 thousands of hotels across Europe. Negative reviews were analyzed and grouped into different categories and topics of complaints.

* Exploratory Data Analysis
  * What are the most frequent words in negative reviews? (frequency distribution)
  * What are top 10 topics of complaints? (using pyLDAvis)
  * Bigrams, Trigrams and Quadgrams

The major challenge faced included but not limited to:
* The extensive time needed to run models due to the large size of the reviews in the dataset
* Most frequent word counts sometimes repeat
