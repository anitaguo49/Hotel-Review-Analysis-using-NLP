# Hotel-Review-NLP-Project
In this project my partner Anita and I processed and analysed text reviews for European Hotel Industry. Our goal was to discover and classify most common issues in negative hotel reviews to particular topics. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, the form of unsupervised learning, to identify the most relevant issues in our topic modeling exercise. Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling, discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents, in our case reviews.
